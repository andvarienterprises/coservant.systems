### Co-Servant Systems - A Consultancy for Busy Teams

Co-Servant Systems is a consultancy and advisory for the work of teams that are busy. These can include:

 - SRE and Devops teams, or Software Engineering teams with a significant operational burden.
 - IT Teams and Service Desks
 - Any other team that has a lot of interrupts!

For a longer blurb on the work, see [The Work](/why/).

The approach taken is both technical and organisational, see [The Method](/how/) for more.


Co-Servant Systems is wholly staffed by [Dave O'Connor](https://log.andvari.net/pages/about.html), a globally-recognised leader in the field of SRE/Devops and interrupt-driven teams.

For more information on the types of work completed and where we could work together, see the [Portfolio](/what/).
