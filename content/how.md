I offer a consultancy and advisory service that specialises in teams that are busy.

What that means can include:

 - Teams that are doing more 'tactical' day-to-day work than they should be.
 - Teams that feel like they're not sure what success looks like; that want to demonstrate to their stakeholders that they're doing important work.
 - Teams that are trying to modernise processes, technology and organisational design, and aren't sure where to start (or continue!)
 - Teams that may be struggling with motivation, attrition or mild to major existential crises based on any or all of the above.

The approach I take generally consists of two complementary approaches:

 - Computer
   - Technical consulting for high-availability systems design.
   - Building good services with meaningful KPIs/[SLOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective).
   - Advice on practices around observability, meaningful alerting and metrics.
   - Oncall and operational practices that work with your org and team.
   - Org-level guidance around incidents, how they're managed (Incident Command), what we learn from them and how to keep stakeholders happy.

 - Human
   - Team charter remit workshopping. Team reboot planning with existing leadership.
   - Building and developing good inter-team relationships across timezones.
   - Key guidance around ownership, sponsoring of key folks and building on existing capabilities.
   - Specific coaching/mentoring for key team members and leadership. See also [my coaching practice](https://www.strategichopes.co).

The overarching goal is to enable cultural and values-based changes that will far outlast my involvement. The model of engagement (embed with the team, assess via review, etc.) is up to you.

I have extensive experience in all the above, at planet-level scale. I wrote the [chapter](https://sre.google/sre-book/dealing-with-interrupts/) of the Google SRE book on busy teams. See my [profile](https://log.andvari.net/pages/about.html) for more.
